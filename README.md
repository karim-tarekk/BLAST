# BLAST

**"Basic Local Alignment Search Tool." BLAST is a widely used bioinformatics software tool for comparing biological sequences such as DNA, RNA, or protein sequences against a database to find similarities and relationships.**

# Aim
BLAST is designed to efficiently search large sequence databases and quickly identify regions of similarity, known as local alignments. By focusing on local alignments rather than global alignments, BLAST can significantly speed up the process while still providing biologically relevant results.
